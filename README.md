# Base Metals
This API is stripped from https://github.com/cyanobacterium/BaseMetals, he made all the crackhammer stuff.
I just put ONLY the crackhammer in an simple API


## Crack Hammer

Also known as a sledgehammer, this tool is designed for pulverizing rocks. Using this tool on ores will cause them to drop powdered metal instead of the standard ore block. Use can then use the powdered metals to make metal alloy mixes or just smelt the powder into ingots. You can crush items by dropping them on the ground and then right-clicking on the ground beneath the items.


##NEI

The Crack Hammer recipes from this mod will appear in NEI if you have NEI installed. Hooray!
